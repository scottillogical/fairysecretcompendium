# Verse Matches

| Verse | Clue | Source
|-------|-------|-------|----------------
| Pass two friends of octave
| In December
| Ride the man of oz
| To the land near the window
| There's a road that leads to
| Dark forest
| Where white is in color
| With two maps
| After circle and square
| In July and August
| A path beckons
| To mica and driftwood
| Under that
| Which may be last touched
| Or first seen standing
| Look north at the wing
| And dig
| To achieve
| By dauntless and inconquerable
| Determination
| Your goal.

# Japanese Hint
>Line 1: octave. Octave usually relates to the number 8, and it’s used in music. However Mr.
>Preiss hints that in this case it is a proper noun. He did not give me further hints.

>Line 18-20: To achieve by dauntless and inconquerable determination.
>This part is a quote from a book, so let’s look at the dictionary of quotations again.

The account has posted a few times and referenced the Roanoke image directly in multiple posts.

> Not too long ago I was watching a film which featured [whirling dervishes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHjFgOfoZ7M&fbclid=IwY2xjawFdnb5leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHa4mGv_sf_mZ7DnjlBOGs5_8KIDvkBjie2qd2bbCJTRTTSi2RO9-q6W_1g_aem_WyF4_p73gLbv3eYBGbvmPA)
In the scene the Sufi has one hand pointing to the sky accepting something from God, and one hand pointed to the earth giving something back. For a brief second I was reminded of the Roanoke painting.
The painting seems to involve parallels doesn't it? One side matching the other, but not exactly.
Left hand accepting, right hand releasing.
Why does the right hand have a string with nothing attached?
Why is the left holding a watch?
Should you add something to the right?
Should you remove something from the left?
Is it the reverse?
How would you know? Maybe there are instructions in the painting. Perhaps a plus and minus sign somewhere.
Are you looking at these paintings correctly?
Is anyone?
I don't remember exactly what John and Byron were going for. Maybe you can help fill in the blanks.
Merry Christmas, see you next year.

### Dare County
A [post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/thesecrettreasures/posts/3422689871350787/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZWsflEFXzN-tODXsTqfaL8wbOW98D9HLq6ILTaa-wMeXy9kboSMRA_Z-GU9piQijsHzJlLlwblxJA_q4iYEB5YrQIVqUBfzcVk0NGifMNKp8KmvU7DowyIbLsB4pkMB0-9ExDG2tueqO3Em1OWy5159zhqrE-E1a2CuG0lM3GXufg&__tn__=%252CO%252CP-R) by Gift Giver that referenced all confirmed cities mentions Dare County, NC specifically. 
#### Analysis
Most of the focus of the Janaury casque has been on Roanoke Island and specifically, the Elizabethan Gardens and Fort Raleigh.  The main exception is the Wright Brothers Memorial, which many searchers believe is referenced at the beginning ("Pass two friends of octave") and possibly the end "Look north to the wind" of the verse.   This hint may be insunuating that the casque is located off the island, or maybe just that the path to the treasure starts or ends off the island. 

### High Resolution image of Painting 3 
The Gift Giver's account also includes [a background photo](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=106894378519864&set=a.106893491853286) of Image 3 that is unusual in that it includes the border of the painting that was cropped out of the book.  We already know from JJP interviews that the Roanoke painting extends beyond the border shown cropped in the book, but this image is a unique.
